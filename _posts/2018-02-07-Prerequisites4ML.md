# Prerequisites

In general, it would be very helpful to speed up your exploration if you have good bases at programming experience, basic linear algebra, statistics and probability to start learning ML.

## Programming Experience

Learning Python is very easy and should not take more than two months to get through with the basics.

```bash
###

```

## Math Background 

Having a solid Math background is very important for any starter in ML or AI. One needs to be pretty good in identifying distributions and deal with them.

Do not panic if you do not have one. Just take the online related courses would be sufficient.

### Basic Linear Algebra

```bash
###

```

### Statistics

```bash
